        The web workers generated by rust-editor are in ESM format, so they have
        `new URL(..., import.meta.url)` calls. This is important for Vite to 
        find the referenced and copy them into the output. However, some browsers
        like Firefox don't support ESM web workers. A hack that seems to work is just
        replacing all `import.meta.url` references with `self.location`.

        Note that has to happen in `writeBundle` and not `transform`, since if we
        make this change too soon, then Vite misses the URLs and doesn't copy the
        assets.
